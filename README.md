This is my Django project, built using Django Rest Framework (DRF). The project is a Pet Adoption Platform that provides users with various features to explore, adopt, and manage pet listings. Key functionalities included: 

💫 Authentication: New users can register on the platform using their email. An activation link is sent to their email to verify and activate their account, ensuring a secure onboarding process.

💫 Pet Adoption: Users can browse available pets for adoption, view detailed pet information, and adopt pets through a simple and intuitive process.

💫 Pet Filtering: Users can easily filter pets by category to smooth their search for specific pets.

💫 User Generated Content: Users can add pets for others to adopt, with the ability to edit or delete their posts at any time.

💫 Review system: After successfully adopting a pet, users can leave reviews, and review options are visible in their profile.

💫 Profile Management: Each user has a personal profile page where they can:

      ⚡ View their account information and balance 
      
      ⚡ See the available posts that they have listed but that hasn't been adopted yet.
      
      ⚡ View their adoption history.

💫 Adoption History Dashboard: A dedicated section that displays the user's adoption history, providing a clear overview of their activity on the platform.

💫 Admin Controls: Administrators have full access to manage the platform. They can add, edit, and delete any posts, ensuring the smooth operation and integrity of the site.
